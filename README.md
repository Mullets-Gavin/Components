Components was created to help provide an open source project to help educate and improve your skills with [Roblox-TS](https://roblox-ts.com) using TSX. You can read more about TSX [here](https://roblox-ts.com/docs/guides/roact-jsx). This project contains a basic outline for a shop, inventory, and money counter. While this is a template for designing UI, you should use this project to learn from and create your own design and system.
