## General Guidelines

This repository is open to anyone to learn or derive from. This follows the 0-license, allowing you to use this in your own works. I'd love credit, but I also won't hunt you down for it.

## UI Guidelines

General UI guidelines I follow to design UI, these are the recommended practices with React which should be applied here.

**Rule of 6:** The rule of 6 is following divisible numbers of 6 evenly, allowing you to write coordinated and controlled UI.
For example: 6/12/18/36
